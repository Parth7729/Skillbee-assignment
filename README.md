# Project Title

A script which generates unique pages dynamically using an api(Bored API). Templating engine - Eta.js is used to generate the pages.

Node provides a built in file handling module - 'fs' which has been used to create and write in the static pages.

Static pages are created inside templates/ folder.

Note: we can change the number of static pages generated by changing the ``` staticFileLimit ``` variable in index.js
